Append scales much better. In small scales the difference is negligable. The difference starts to become apparent with the largeArray. Append appears to be following linear runtime while insert is following aquadratic runtime.

The slower function uses unshift which adds an element to the front of the array. This means that javascript engine needs to shift every element that is already in the array one index to the right. Versus the push method that it simply adds the element to the end of the array and doesnt require moving any existing elements.
